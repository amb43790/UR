  * Queries with the -recurse option are suppored for all datasources, not just those that support recursive queries directly
  * Make the object listers more user-friendly by implicitly putting '%' wildcards on either side of the user-supplied 'like' filter
  * Update to the latest version of Getopt::Complete for command-line completion
  * Object Set fixes (non-datasource expressable filters)
  * Bugfixes for queries involving multiple joins to the same table with different join conditions
  * Queries with -offset/-limit and -page are now supported.
  * Query efficiency improvements
  * Command module fixes
  * Deleted objects hanging around as UR::DeletedRefs are recycled if the original object gets re-created

libur-perl (0.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New class (Command::SubCommandFactory) which can act as a factory for a tree of sub-commands
  * Remove the distinction between older and newer versions of DBD::SQLite installed on the system.  If you have SQLite databases (including MetaDBs) with names like "*sqlite3n*", they will need to be renamed to "*sqlite3*".
  * Make the tests emit fewer messages to the terminal when run in the harness; improve coverage on non-Intel/Linux systems.

  * New environment variable (UR_DBI_SUMMARIZE_SQL) to help find query optimization targets
  * View aspects for objects' primitive values use the appropriate UR::Value View classes
  * Query engine remembers cases where a left join matches nothing, and skips asking the datasource on subsequent similar queries
  * Committing a software transaction now performs the same data consistancy checking as the top-level transaction.
  * Improved document auto-generation for Command classes
  * Improved SQLite Data Source schema introspection
  * Updated database handling for Pg and mysql table case sensitivity
  * UR's developer tools (ur command-line tool) can operate on non-standard source tree layouts, and can be forced to operate on a namespace with a command-line option
  * Support for using a chain of properties in queries ('a.b.c like' => $v)
  * Set operations normalized: min, max, sum, count
  * Set-to-set relaying is now correctly lazy
  * Objects previously loaded from the database, and later deleted from the database, are now detected as deleted and handled as another type of change to be merged with in-memory changes.
